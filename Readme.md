a. This project is looking through a bunch of files and determining the 
probability the file is spam . It will do this through the use of a spam detector.The spamdectector
will be creted when looking through the files in the train folder. It will display a table of the results found.

b. The improvements I made are for the the table scene I have the columns and the table adjust to the screensize
of the window. This means as you make the window bigger you can still se the window clearly and it adjusts with screen size.
Also I created another scene kind of like the title page for the spam detector which appears first right as you open. Then I added a button called
"Table" which when clicked will take you to the next scene which is where the information displayed in the table. Also note when you click the button there could be a delay in 
switching scenes so please be patient. If forever reason it's not switching scenes please just run the program again a few times.  

c. 1. First you should clone the program into the proper directory 
   2. You should have a directory that contans the "data folder" of all the files in train and ham
   3. Make sure that that the data folder and the file you download from the repository are in the same directory
   4. compile and run the program
